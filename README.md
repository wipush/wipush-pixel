What is Social Proof?
Social proof is the concept that people will follow the actions of the masses. The idea is that since so many other people behave in a certain way, it must be the correct behavior.

Let’s go back to the restaurant example for a second. The reason you’re tempted to visit one of the restaurants with people in it instead of an empty one is because you assume the empty restaurants aren’t as good. After all, if they served good food, people would be in them, right?

That’s social proof in action. Even if the empty restaurants actually have better food and service, since more people are in the other ones, the assumption is they’re better.

Social proof isn’t new. There have been several studies conducted on the topic that show people are more likely to conform to the group decision. One classic example is the Solomon Asch conformity experiment that took place in 1951.

Asch was a psychologist who wanted to test the theory that people are likely to conform to the choice of the majority, even if the decision is clearly wrong.

For the experiment, Asch gathered male college students to participate in a line judgement task. Each group was shown images like the ones below:

Solomon Asch Line Test
They had to state which line (A,B or C) matched the target line on the left. Asch divided participants into groups of eight. However, only one of the people in each group was actually being tested. The other seven (let’s call them the insiders) agreed beforehand what their answers would be, which the real participant had no idea about.

Each person had to state which line was most like the target line. The correct answer was always obvious, and the real participant went last each time. There were a total of 18 trials, and the insiders were told to give wrong answers in 12 of them. During those 12 tests, 75% of the unknowing participants conformed and gave the wrong answer at least once.

In the other six trials when the insiders gave the right answer, the unknowing participant gave the wrong answer less than 1% of the time.

When Asch asked the unknowing participants why they conformed, he found that people follow social proof for one of two reasons:

They want to fit in with the group.
They believe the group is better informed than they are.
As you can imagine, social proof can be a very powerful tool for marketers when used correctly. By showcasing the popularity of your brand, products and services, you can make people more confident that you’re the right choice for them.
